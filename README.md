# Poké-Gochi

## Summary

Welcome to the world of Poké-Gochi, an interactive app where users ("Trainers") can interact, level up, and train virtual Pokémon! By consuming a companion API that serializes data from the official [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), this app renders GIF's and data while providing functionality for trainers to interact with their Pokémon! The project was completed by a team of five developers over a focused 10-day sprint.
